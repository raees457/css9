        <h1>ABOUT BLACK HOLE IN SPACE</h1>
        <P>A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space.<BR> This can happen when a star is dying.<BR>

            Because no light can get out, <BR>people can't see black holes. They are invisible.<BR> Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes.<BR> The special tools can see how stars that are very close <BR>to black holes act differently than<BR> other stars</P>

        <p class="clear">In 1865, the velocipede (meaning
            "fast foot") attached pedals to the front wheel,
            but its wooden structure made it extremely
            uncomfortable.</p>
