        <p class="p-1"> wheat is one of the world's most commonly consumed cereal grains.

            It comes from a type of grass (Triticum) that is grown in countless varieties worldwide.
            
            Bread wheat, or common wheat, is the primary species. Several other closely related species include durum, spelt, emmer, einkorn, and Khorasan wheat.
            
            White and whole-wheat flour are key ingredients in baked goods, such as bread. Other wheat-based foods include pasta, noodles, semolina, bulgur, and couscous.
            
            Wheat is highly controversial because it contains a protein called gluten, which can trigger a harmful immune response in predisposed individuals.
            
            However, for people who tolerate it, whole-grain wheat can be a rich source of various antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
